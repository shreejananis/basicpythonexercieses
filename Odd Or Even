#Python Code to find if the number input by a user is odd or even
Num = input ("Enter A number please") #Input a number from user
Div = Num/2 #Check if it's odd or even
if (Div > 0):
    Print (" It's an Odd Number!") #Display if it's odd
Else:
    Print("It's an Even Number!")  #Display If it's even
